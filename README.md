# sign-language
The sign laguage project is a project that translates the a sign of the american sign language to the corresponding word in real time. In this project I used an innovative and new approach to treat the signs of the words in american the sign language. So I used labelIMG to make the labeling of the signs that we will use.
Techniques used: Python, Transfer learning, OpenCV.
